We're now going to run your first server and play around with a few existing **endpoints** that it has.

## Learning Outcomes

- Write endpoint tests for an express server with `supertest`
- Use Jest's documentation on matchers
- Use Jest's `toMatch` matcher with a regular expression
- Load an environment variable from a `.env` file into Node

## Exercise 1: Installing, running and testing

**Success criterion:** you can view evidence your server is running at `localhost:4000` and run its tests (which should all pass)

Clone/fork the repo so that you have it locally, then view the `scripts` available in `package.json`. This should give you an idea of what you can run to get the server started and run its tests.

(The server doesn't need to be running for you to run tests - [`supertest`](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) is a testing library that lets us test HTTP requests.)

## Exercise 5: Check your understanding

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** a conversation with a Faculty member and amended comments.

Talk to a member of Faculty about your understanding of the server and of TypeScript.

Amend your notes for any important points that come out of the conversation.

## Exercise 6: Commentary and reflection

**Success criterion:** documented reflections.
